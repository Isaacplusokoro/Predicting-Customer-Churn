**Project Title:**
Predicting Customer Churn

**Project Overview**

In this project, we will work with a real-world dataset from a telecom company that includes
customer information, such as demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned (i.e., left
the company) or not. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis, explore key patterns and trends,
and create visualizations to gain insights into factors influencing customer churn.

**Project Objectives:**
1. Clean and preprocess the raw dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
2. Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of key variables.
3. Identify factors that may be associated with customer churn.
4. Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

**Project Description**

Customer churn refers to the number or percentage of customers who stop doing business with a company over a given period. In other words, it is the rate at which customers leave or discontinue using a company's products or services. Churn can be caused by various reasons such as dissatisfaction with the product or service, competitive offerings, changes in customer needs, or external factors. Understanding and managing customer churn is important for businesses as it can have a significant impact on revenue, growth, and customer satisfaction. In this project we are going to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.

**Project Tasks:**
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
